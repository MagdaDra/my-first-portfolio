				I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in Industrial Engineering. 5 years of experience working in
				e-commerce and tech companies, leading diverse teams and projects. In the last few months, I have decided 
				for a career change. I have always been curious how things function inside out and while working for a tech 
				company I got really inspired by the Internet products. that is why when it came to the career patch choice, 
				my natural selection was Web Development. I had spent 6 months studying MERN stack development and the world 
				behind Internet browsers and servers. During this challenging time combined with full time work, I proved 
				myself to be a fast, goal-oriented learner with a passion for problem-solving. I found a lot of creativity 
				and logical thinking in the process of developing websites that kept me motivated and brought reassurance 
				that it is where I want my career to be going. At the moment, I am working on personal projects and looking 
				for a job where I could apply all my skills and keep growing profesionally.
